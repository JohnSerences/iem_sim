# iem_sim

Code to implement a simple neuron-to-voxel-to-IEM simulation similar in spirit to the simulations in Gardner and Liu, 2019 eNeuro.

In this version we implement a simulated experiment that has two conditions, one with higher gain than the other at the neural level, and show that the difference between conditions is generally preserved across linear transforms of the model basis (see text of paper for more nuanced explanation). 

Tested on Matlab2016B and later...please let us know if you encounter any issues or have questions.
